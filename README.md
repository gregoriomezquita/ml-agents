## Deep Reinforcement Learning in Unity ML-Agents

My solution to several [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) environments:
+ [Navigation](https://github.com/gregoriomezquita/ml-agents/tree/master/Navigation) Value based DQN algorithm to catch yellow bananas.
+ [Reacher](https://github.com/gregoriomezquita/ml-agents/tree/master/Reacher) Policy based DDPG algorithm for an arm to reach and follow some point.
+ [Reacher-20](https://github.com/gregoriomezquita/ml-agents/tree/master/Reacher-20) The same as above but with 20 agents.
+ [Tennis](https://github.com/gregoriomezquita/ml-agents/tree/master/Tennis) Competition agents.
+ [Soccer](https://github.com/gregoriomezquita/ml-agents/tree/master/Soccer) Competition and colaboration agents. Coming soon
